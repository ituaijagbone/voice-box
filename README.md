# voice-box
Most times I call it Box. I call it Box because it envelopes a lot of things around taken notes and voice. The app works in various ways. Currently you record your voice as an audio book. The recorded audio is turned to text through WIT.AI (it has an option for using Google Speech Recognition and IBM Watson). This text is sent to Evernote where it's stored. Recordings are stored in Dropbox. Notes can be edited and can have things like hashtag (optional). Touching the hashtag can give you the option to use Spotify. You can play the audio and read the transcribed text at the same time.

Parse serves as my backend for data storage while it last. :)

One more feature to be added is sending the audio to Clarify where it is indexed for searching. Clarify makes it possible to search our voice notes.
